here is what has been added:

    altered wall jumping

    added the ability to make more of the map easier

    made \ commands work differently

    added to the map

    added the ability to die

    added button prompts

    probably more

the wall jumps now degrade over time on a single wall, move to another one to regain the ability to wall jump well, this also shows the new button prompts!


there is now an ability to die, after a short delay, you will respawn

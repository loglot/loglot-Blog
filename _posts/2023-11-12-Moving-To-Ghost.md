title: Moving To Ghost!
tags: Meta Ghost

Due to the new “sponsored content” feature, and needing to pay for a dark mode blog in WordPress, along with other reasons, i’m moving to ghost for this blog! it’s open source, and has a great free plan, the main hassle with moving was bringing the old posts through, but now that that’s done, this could be way better

now i do miss one thing I made on accident in WordPress, but we can leave that in the past

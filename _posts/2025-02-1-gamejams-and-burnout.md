I joined a the [pirate software Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pirate/rate/3283345)! woooooo


however, this game jam was 14 days long

I had 5 days to make it work.

I really love what I made, I think it turned out great, but making a game takes effort, and effort - time is the perfect way to burn out of making games temporarily, I will most definitely go back to work on my main game ([Yet Another 2d Platformer](https://loglot.github.io/Yet-Another-2d-Platformer/)) but I will need some time

I also know that basically no-one knows who I am, thus no-one cares. 

I don't care that no-one cares, but. I could get word out on things I make

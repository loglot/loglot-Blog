# short answer: 
this is my new blog!

## "but wait, as a voice in your head because nobody knows about your other blogs, isn't this like your fourth blog?":

Yes. it is. the other blogs i have used have had issues, 

## WordPress: 
forced ads onto free blogs, and didn't allow darkmode for free blogs

## Ghost: 
requires payment or self hosting

## SpaceHey: 
actually pretty decent, will probably crosspost some blog posts there, but it isn't as inviting to post my backlog of content

## the 4-5 blogs i have sacrificed in the making of this one: 
they were all broken in different ways, and i just had to restart and restart until i landed here


### The Plan:
the plan for this blog is to archive all of my previous attempts at blogging, and function as a new environment for me to post new things, this will also be a good place to show off what i am working on (if i remember to update this)

over the next few days i will try to get all of my old posts, and get them here, here's to a new blogging experiance!

title: hitboxes!

hitboxes are a necessity in any game, my game is no exception, they have been added.

the new hitbox allows for corner boosting! this could be used for some neat secrets (however it is a frame perfect move)

This is a very short update, however it is the first one I have made, so here are some things that are done already, 

motion, 

the camera, 

showing the hitbox for the player, 

noclip, 

hiding the player. 

now all of this is subject to change because this is a very early build, but these all feel good to me.

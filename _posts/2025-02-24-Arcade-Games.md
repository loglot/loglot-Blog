i have made many games, over these few years, and i think it would be good to list them all in one post, 

# Yet Another Collectathon

the first game, made on a whim over a month, then remade later to see how it could change

# Yet Another 2d Platformer

second game, made to be a massive project, took way longer than expected, and still in passive development today, 

# Yet Another Flappy Game

Made in 24 hours. i was trying to teach someone how to make a game in javascript, and i ended up liking the little demo, and made it into a small game

this game has also gotten a remaster, into pixel art, because why not?

# Yet Another Bouncer

this is a game i have made multiple times, over different stages of development, this is by far the best version i have made

# Yet Another Space Game

a glorified tech demo, you are a spaceship, traversing something, this idea went nowhere due to how it started being coded. i don't even know what i wanted to do with it.

# Yet Another Twin Stick Shooter

a fairly fun game made for the Pirate Software GameJam, i had half of the alocated time, so it was a bit janky, but i would love to come back to this concept

# Yet Another Idle Game

a game made based on Yet Another Collectathon, expanded to have a lot of features, but it inflated too much for me to continue work on it, i would love to see how it could grow and be finalized, but that is not for me at this moment

# Yet Another Music Player
i wanted to make a music player, so i did, it's a bit messed up, but i like how it looks

# Yet Another Game Engine
i made a game engine to help me make games much faster, i have made a few tests in it, but not a full game yet

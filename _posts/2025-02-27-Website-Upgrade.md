# Problems
my website is... well, it looks good, but it is a pain to update with new games or projects, and this blog is really easy to update with new posts. soo...

i turned my website into a glorified blog.

# how it works
each game is it's own inacessable post, with meta data saying the name of the game, the icon it should use, and a link to the game, the posts get shown on a page showing what is in it, it looks the same as the older website, but it is different

each general element (like see more) is also a post, getting a specific one of these is gonna be a pain to get, but i can make new ones easily, and if it is used in multiple places, they will all stay the same

the new site isn't fully set up yet, but i am currentally making it function

it is a very whaky way to make a website of this type, but it is better than having 7 html files that have their own copy of everything, making updating something a massive pain, i hope with doing this, that i can keep my website updated
